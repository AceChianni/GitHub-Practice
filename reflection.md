1. Why is source control, especially Git, important for software development? Explain the problems that source control systems like Git help solve and the benefits they offer.

**For collaboration efforts in order to track changes, create consistency in language, a backup recovery file in case any techinical errors or data loss, etc.**

2. How do local and remote repositories differ, and why is synchronization between them essential when working with Git? Provide a clear understanding of these two aspects of Git.

**Local repositiories seem to be mainly used for solo coding purposes while the remote ones allow you to collaborate easier. Synchronization is essential to allow for a smooth transistion when it comes to creating a project and keeping the code uniform and easy to read**
