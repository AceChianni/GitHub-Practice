Day One

1. Why is source control, especially Git, important for software development? Explain the problems that source control systems like Git help solve and the benefits they offer.

**For collaboration efforts in order to track changes, create consistency in language, a backup recovery file in case any techinical errors or data loss, etc.**

2. How do local and remote repositories differ, and why is synchronization between them essential when working with Git? Provide a clear understanding of these two aspects of Git.

**Local repositiories seem to be mainly used for solo coding purposes while the remote ones allow you to collaborate easier. Synchronization is essential to allow for a smooth transistion when it comes to creating a project and keeping the code uniform and easy to read**

Day Two

Write a brief reflection on your experience with the commit cycle and synchronization inside your synchronization.txt. Include any challenges you encountered and how you resolved them. Also, describe any insights gained from the collaborative aspects of Git synchronization.

**This practice wasnt too difficult. I got to learn more about the process of using the pull methods to sync up the changes made on github to my local repository.**
